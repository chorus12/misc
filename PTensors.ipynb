    "Sometimes you'll want to change the shape of a tensor more radically, while still preserving the number of elements and their contents. One case where this happens is at the interface between a convolutional layer of a model and a linear layer of the model - this is common in image classification models. A convolution kernel will yield an output tensor of shape *features x width x height,* but the following linear layer expects a 1-dimensional input. `reshape()` will do this for you, provided that the dimensions you request yield the same number of elements as the input tensor has:"
